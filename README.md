# FastAPI

Welcome to the **FastAPI** repository!

This repository is dedicated to projects, experiments, or sample applications built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## What This Repository Contains

- **FastAPI Applications**: Code samples and projects built with FastAPI demonstrating various features such as routing, dependency injection, authentication, request/response models, and more.
- **API Examples**: Example endpoints showcasing best practices for building RESTful APIs, including CRUD operations, validation, and error handling.
- **Configuration Files**: Environment and configuration files to help you get started quickly (such as `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, etc.).
- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides and code comments to help you understand and extend the examples in this repository.
- **Testing Setup**: Example tests (where present) for FastAPI endpoints using tools like `pytest`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepak179/FastAPI.git
   cd FastAPI
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the FastAPI application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   *(Assuming your entrypoint is `main.py` and the FastAPI instance is named `app`.)*

4. **Visit the interactive API docs:**
   - [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) (Swagger UI)
   - [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) (ReDoc)

## Features

- **Asynchronous support** for high performance.
- **Automatic interactive API documentation** (Swagger UI & ReDoc).
- **Type hints and data validation** using Pydantic.
- **Easy integration with databases and background tasks.**
